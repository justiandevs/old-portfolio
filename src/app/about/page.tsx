              I am Justian Spijkerbosch. A full stack developer from Apeldoorn, Netherlands. I have been a hobby programmer for a number of years and since mid 2021 I have been studying computer science in Utrecht, the Netherlands. At this moment I work as a freelance full stack developer and in addition, I love to explore and learn new techniques by working on my own projects.

        <h2 className="mt-8 md:mt-0">My daily life</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">I am currently doing an internship at <a href="https://mrboost.nl" target="_blank">MrBoost</a>, completing year 2 of my degree. At MrBoost I am fully focusing on becoming better in interaction development. I am doing this through learning about techniques such as GSAP and ThreeJS and building great projects with both of them.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">Besides wanting to become a better interaction developer, I am also always trying out (new) techniques and building cool projects with them, either for myself, or for others. I am always open to new challenges and in addition, I am not a quitter and like to work on finding solutions to deep technical problems.</p>
        <p className="mt-6">In my daily life, I otherwise enjoy spending time in nature, by taking walks or biking. I can also be found in the gym almost every day and for me this is the perfect combination with sitting at my desk most of the day as a programmer.</p>
        <h2 className="mt-8"><span className="line-through">Dreaming about you</span> My dreams</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          As an interaction developer I would love to win an <a href="https://awwwards.com" target="_blank">awwward</a>. Being a programmer, I would think it would be really cool to work at a company in the future, or work for myself, on a piece of software which preferably solves a social problem. In my private life, I would like to create the opportunity for myself to leave my childhood home and continue working on my software developer career somewhere on my own. In addition, I would like to grow further in the strength sports I am currently involved in almost daily.

          <p className="mt-2">I have a good to very good command of all the skills listed below and can build complex systems with them. I also have a large number of reasonable skills such as small javascript libraries and various other programming languages. However, I do not have enough experience with these to list them below.</p>
