          In my daily life, I am mainly busy with school, for which I am currently doing an internship at <a href="https://mrboost.nl">MrBoost</a>. In addition, as an indie hacker / solo entrepreneur I like to build <Link href={"/work"}>my projects</Link>. To finance this I am also active as a freelancer, for which you can <Link href={"/contact"}>hire me</Link>.
