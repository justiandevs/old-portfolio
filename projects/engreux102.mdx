## What is Engreux102?
Engreux102 is the website about the cottage of my neighbors Joop and Ineke. The website is aimed at informing people about the possibilities of staying with them: What does the cottage consist of, and what is there to do in the neighborhood? Those were the two biggest questions the website needed to answer.

## Technical requirements
The website had to be simple and come up high in the search results when people specifically search for my neighbor's cottage or specifically search for a cottage in Engreux or the Engreux area. By using NextJS and some other techniques, the website is very fast and can be found well within Google, which has already brought the necessary visitors.

## Tech stack
I used several techniques to build this site:

- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
