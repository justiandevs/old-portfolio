## What is archive MrBoost
This archive website is a website to show a lot of pictures that were made since MrBoost started as a company, just to give visitors a nice general visual overview of the last years.

## What I did for this website
This website is using a lot of javascript techniques and browser technology like GSAP and WebGL with ThreeJS. To give people the possibility to manage the content on this website I integrated everything with Kirby CMS, so that people without any programming knowledge can make the decision to change icons, text or photos. I've builded the whole site including all things like the integration with Kirby and the 3D logic with ThreeJS and animations with GSAP.
